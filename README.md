Beta version of the inteRn R-package. 
This package is a collection of functions used by medical students and PGY1 residents in every day clinical practice. 
The package is still in it's developing stages and currently contains only 15 functions. I will iteratively add new functions. 
My hope is that, in some years, this package will contain most of the functions needed in the practice of general adult medicine.
