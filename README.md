# inteRn

Development version of R-Package to perform calculations of simple, quick, every day scores used in MS4 and PGY1 year. 
Currently this package contains little over 15 functions. I will add more iteratively. 
My hope is that, by the end of my training in several years, this package will contain hundreds of useful scores.
